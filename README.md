  - [ ] make intel chips work by [making a universal `server` binary](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/building-a-universal-macos-binary#Update-the-Architecture-List-of-Custom-Makefiles)
  - [ ] App icon
  - [ ] New name (I think Chats is taken)
  - [ ] Conversation null state
  - [ ] user can copy conversation
  - [ ] make it not crash on super long chats by limiting the context passed to llm
  - [ ] new conversation should focus textarea
  - [ ] toast notif for errors https://github.com/sanzaru/SimpleToast
